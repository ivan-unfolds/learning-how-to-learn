# Learning how to learn 🤓

## Short intro

<SplitRight>

<img

  style={{
    width: "70%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

- This is me ->
- I was part of FAC7
- I work for InFact, a cooperative made up of 3 FAC alumni

## Why should you care about this? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- As developers, we want to be constantly learning (but we won't get much time to)
- Ultimately it's about the return on our time investment (and time is the only finite resource we have)
- The better we can make use of this time, the more beautiful products we'll be able to build

<Notes>

- Notes
  - We want to be constantly learning because coding things you already know how to do get boring real quick
  - This isn't just about coding, this applies to life in general

</Notes>

---

## The takeaways 🎬

- We're really bad at judging how well we're learning (which leads us to use inefficient learning practices)
- Learning that feels easy is easily forgotten (i.e. to be useful learning should feel hard)

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Heard somewhere that we should start with the conclusion

</Notes>

---

## How we delude ourselves 🥴

- Most of us use study techniques that give us a false sense of confidence
- Rereading and highlighting texts (the two most common study methods) lead to the biggest delusions
- Learning illusions are a type of cognitive bias (which means we all fall prey to them)

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Cramming is an example of this
  - Why is the sky blue?
  - A book you just read or a Ted talk

</Notes>

---

## Can we avoid deluding ourselves?

- Yes! We can use better methods for studying and learning
- The bad news is that in the short term it will take more effort and slow you down
- The good news is that it works like compound interest - in the long run, your results will increase exponentially

## Active participant‍ 🏃🏽‍♂️ vs passive absorber 👀

<img
  src={learningPyramid}
  style={{
    maxWidth: "800px",
    width: "70vw",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

<Notes>

- Notes
  - The FAC week follows the structure quite well
  - This is why you are discouraged from copy/pasting, it puts you in the passive end of the spectrum

</Notes>

# What study techniques lead to robust durable learning? 💪🏽

---

## First, a brief foray into the science of learning 👩🏽‍🔬

### Learning works in 3 stages 3️⃣

1. Initial encoding - memory traces are 'encoded' in your short term memory
2. Consolidation - the new material is connected to prior learning
3. Retrieval - the learning is made durable and easily accessible

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Variable -> symbol in algebra -> box that we can put something into
  - The more you know the more you can know (languages)

</Notes>

---

## Effortful retrieval

- An analogy is making a path in a dense forest
- Emphasis on the "effortful" part

<Notes>

- Notes
  - How do you make a path more defined? How do you make the destination easier to get to?
  - Effortful as opposed to cramming

</Notes>

---

## Desirable difficulties

- There are some difficulties that you can impose on yourself when learning that make learning likely to stick better
- The more effort required to retrieve something, the better you learn it

<Notes>

- Example: do not copy and paste

</Notes>

---

## Desirably difficult method number 1: Self-testing 🧪

- A typical example of this is flashcards (although they have limited scope for programming)
- Go through a tutorial, then the next day build it again without looking at the tutorial
- Works best when some forgetting has already set in (as opposed to cramming)
- Should be low-stakes

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Tutorial on how to test a server
  - Flashcards might be helpful for definitions

</Notes>

---

## Advantages of self-testing

- Effortful retrieval so learning is securely embedded
- Helps uncover the gaps in our knowledge

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Of course one of the best forms of self-testing is to build something
  - Important to develop a good nose for these gaps

</Notes>

---

## Desirably difficult method number 2: Generation 🧞‍♂️

- Attempting to solve a problem without being shown the solution
- Open our brains up for learning 🧠
- We're leveraging our emotions to make the learning stick when we're eventually shown the answer

<!--
<Highlighter language="javascript" style={shadesOfPurple}>

{`const funFacts = {ivan: "likes to 🧘🏽‍♂️"}
const funFactsCopy = {ivan: "likes to 🧘🏽‍♂️"}

console.log(funFacts === funFactsCopy)
`}


</Highlighter>
-->

<!-- todo look at Dan Abramov's Javascript building blocks for examples of foundational parts -->

<Notes>

- Notes
  - An example of this is morning challenges
  - By struggling -> challenge assumptions
  - In a sense, you are leveraging your emotions here. If you get it right, you'll get a dopamine hit which will lodge the learning in your brain better, if it was incorrect the negative emotion will serve to lodge the memory in

</Notes>

---

## Desirable difficulty number 3: Elaboration ✍️

- Elaboration is when you give material new meaning by expressing it in your own words
- You connect it to what you already know, helping your brain know where to embed the knowledge

---

## There's always a cost 💵

- These techniques will slow you down
- They will take more mental energy
- You'll have to get used to not knowing the answer and to making errors
- ...and the emotions that come with that 😞

<Notes>

- Notes
  - These impediments will more than compensate for their inconvenience by making the learning stronger, more precise and more enduring.
  - Not just for coding - having to let go of my attachments to just read books without thinking too much about them
  - Good to set proper expectations

</Notes>

---

## Countering the myth of errorless learning

- It is about the meaning that we make out of our "failures"
- Growth mindset
- "Failure" as a signal for growth

<Notes>

- Notes
  - We have to get used to this feeling, because this feeling is the signal that we are learning best
  - When babies are learning to walk or run they are constantly "failing". The difference is that they don't assign any meaning to it.

</Notes>

---

## Bonus tips 💯

- Practice like you play and you will play like you practice 🏅
- Be strategic about your learning
- Don't be afraid to invest in your learning
- Have a learning repository repository 📝

<Notes>

- Notes
  - Learning French in a classroom versus talking about it
  - I tend to veer to the side of analytical consumption, learn to recognise where you veer to and try to have a balance

</Notes>

---

## Going full circle ⚪

- We're really bad at judging how well we're learning (which leads us to use inefficient learning practices)
- Learning that feels easy is easily forgotten (i.e. to be useful learning should feel hard)

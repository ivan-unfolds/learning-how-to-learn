# Learning how to learn 🤓

## Intro

    width: "70%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

- This is me ->
- I was part of FAC7
- I work for InFact, a cooperative made up of 3 FAC alumni

## My motivation for this talk

- I love getting to root causes 🦷
- e.g. operating systems, keystone habits, force multipliers
- Return on time investment
- Learning to create and to share

## Being in relationship with learning

<Notes>


- Notes
  - The FAC week follows the structure quite well
  - This is why you are discouraged from copy/pasting, it puts you in the passive end of the spectrum

</Notes>

# What does this mean in practice? 💪🏽

---

## First, a brief foray into the science of learning 👩🏽‍🔬

### Learning works in 3 stages 3️⃣

<li style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
  Initial encoding - memory traces are 'encoded' in your short term memory
</li>

<li style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
  Consolidation - the new material is connected to prior learning
</li>

<li style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
  Retrieval - the learning is made durable and easily accessible
</li>

<Notes>


- Notes
  - Variable -> symbol in algebra -> box that we can put something into
  - The more you know the more you can know (languages)

</Notes>


---

## Effortful retrieval

- An analogy is making a path in a dense forest
- Emphasis on the "effortful" part

<Notes>


- Notes
  - How do you make a path more defined? How do you make the destination easier to get to?
  - Effortful as opposed to cramming

</Notes>


---

## Desirable difficulties

- There are some difficulties that you can impose on yourself when learning that make learning likely to stick better
- The more effort required to retrieve something, the better you learn it

<Notes>


- Example: do not copy and paste

</Notes>


---

## Desirably difficult method number 1: Self-testing 🧪

- A typical example of this is flashcards (although they have limited scope for programming)
- Go through a tutorial, then the next day build it again without looking at the tutorial

<Notes>


- Effortful retrieval so learning is securely embedded
- Helps uncover the gaps in our knowledge

</Notes>


---

## Desirably difficult method number 2: Generation 🧞‍♂️

- Attempting to solve a problem without being shown the solution
- We're leveraging our emotions to make the learning stick when we're eventually shown the answer

<Notes>


- An example of this is morning challenges
- By struggling -> challenge assumptions

</Notes>


---

## Desirable difficulty number 3: Elaboration ✍️

- Elaboration is when you give material new meaning by expressing it in your own words
- You connect it to what you already know, helping your brain know where to embed the knowledge

---

## There's always a cost 💵

- These techniques will slow you down
- They will take more mental energy
- You'll have to get used to not knowing the answer and to making errors
- ...and the <b>emotions</b> that come with that 😞

<Notes>


- These impediments will more than compensate for their inconvenience by making the learning stronger, more precise and more enduring.
- Good to set proper expectations
- It is about the meaning that we make out of our "failures"
- When babies are learning to walk or run they are constantly "failing". The difference is that they don't assign any meaning to it.

</Notes>

## Bonus tips 💯

- Practice like you play and you will play like you practice 🏅
- Be strategic about your learning
- Don't be afraid to invest in your learning
- Have a learning repository 📝

<Notes>


- Notes
  - Learning French in a classroom versus talking about it
  - I tend to veer to the side of analytical consumption, learn to recognise where you veer to and try to have a balance

</Notes>
